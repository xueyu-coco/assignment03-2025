```

## ÔøΩ Customization

### Difficulty Adjustment
Edit `voice_fireworks.py` for custom challenge levels:
```python
# Monster spawn rate (seconds between spawns)
self.monster_spawn_timer = 3.0    # Decrease for harder difficulty

# Player health
self.player_health = 30           # Reduce for hardcore mode  

# Monster damage
fireball_damage = 10              # Increase for extreme challenge (currently 1/3 of health)

# Monster speed range
speed = random.uniform(0.5, 2.0)  # Increase max for faster monsters
```

### Visual Customization
```python
# Custom firework colors
color_sets = [
    [(255, 0, 0), (255, 100, 0), (255, 255, 0)],    # Red-Orange-Yellow
    [(0, 100, 255), (100, 0, 255), (255, 0, 255)],  # Blue-Purple-Pink
    [(0, 255, 0), (100, 255, 100), (200, 255, 200)], # Green variations
    # Add your custom color schemes here
]

# Monster appearance
monster_colors = [
    (150, 0, 0),      # Dark red
    (0, 100, 0),      # Dark green
    (100, 0, 100),    # Purple
    # Add more monster types
]
```

### Audio Sensitivity Tuning
```python
# Voice detection sensitivity
self.volume_threshold = 0.002     # Lower = more sensitive
self.max_volume = 0.5            # Adjust based on microphone
self.firework_cooldown = 0.15    # Time between launches (seconds)

# Audio amplification
self.signal_amplification = 2.0   # Increase for quieter microphones
self.sensitivity_boost = 1.5      # Additional sensitivity multiplier
```

### Gameplay Modifications
```python
# Firework power scaling
explosion_size = int(50 + size_multiplier * 100)    # Blast radius
particle_count = int(30 + size_multiplier * 50)     # Explosion intensity

# Monster behavior
attack_cooldown = random.uniform(2.0, 5.0)          # Attack frequency
max_monsters = 8                                     # Simultaneous monsters
