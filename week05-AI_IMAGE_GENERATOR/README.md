## üé® Creative Tips

### AI Image Generation
- **Animal Prompts**: "cute brown teddy bear sitting in garden, fluffy fur, adorable expression"
- **Cartoon Style**: "cartoon style brown dog, big eyes, happy expression, children's book illustration"
- **Quality Enhancers**: Add "high quality, detailed, professional" to improve results

### Video Effects
- **Face Detection**: Ensure good lighting for optimal face detection
- **Dynamic Overlays**: Generated images automatically scale and position on detected faces
- **Real-time Performance**: Use GPU acceleration for smooth video processing

### Effective Prompts
- **Be specific**: Use detailed descriptions instead of vague terms
- **Include style**: Specify art styles like "oil painting", "cartoon style", "photorealistic"
- **Add quality modifiers**: Use terms like "high quality", "detailed", "professional"
- **Describe lighting**: Include lighting conditions like "soft lighting", "golden hour"

### Example Prompts
- **Landscape**: "serene mountain lake at sunset, golden hour lighting, reflection in water, detailed, cinematic"
- **Portrait**: "portrait of a wise old wizard, detailed face, magical atmosphere, fantasy art style"
- **Animal**: "cute red panda sitting on bamboo, fluffy fur, adorable expression, soft lighting"

### Negative Prompts
Use negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements:
- "blurry, low quality, distorted, ugly, poorly drawn"
- "extra limbs, deformed, mutated, bad anatomy"

## üîß Configuration

### GPU Setup
The application automatically detects and uses GPU acceleration when available. For optimal performance:

1. Install CUDA toolkit
2. Use the CUDA-optimized requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r cuda_torch_requirements.txt
   ```

### Model Configuration
The project uses Stable Diffusion v1.5 with LCM (Latent Consistency Model) for fast generation. Models are automatically downloaded on first use and cached for future sessions.

### Video Processing
- **Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV Haar cascades for real-time face detection
- **Thread Safety**: Implements thread-safe communication between UI and video processing
- **File Caching**: Uses pickle-based caching for cross-thread image sharing
- **WebRTC**: Leverages streamlit-webrtc for real-time video streaming
