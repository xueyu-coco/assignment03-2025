## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Web interface framework
- **Diffusers**: Hugging Face diffusion models
- **Transformers**: Natural language processing
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing
- **PIL/Pillow**: Image manipulation
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework

### System Requirements
- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM, Intel i5 or equivalent
- **Recommended**: 16GB+ RAM, NVIDIA RTX 3060 or better
- **Storage**: 10GB+ free space for models

## üé® Prompt Engineering Tips

### Effective Prompts
- **Be specific**: Use detailed descriptions instead of vague terms
- **Include style**: Specify art styles like "oil painting", "cartoon style", "photorealistic"
- **Add quality modifiers**: Use terms like "high quality", "detailed", "professional"
- **Describe lighting**: Include lighting conditions like "soft lighting", "golden hour"

### Example Prompts
- **Landscape**: "serene mountain lake at sunset, golden hour lighting, reflection in water, detailed, cinematic"
- **Portrait**: "portrait of a wise old wizard, detailed face, magical atmosphere, fantasy art style"
- **Animal**: "cute red panda sitting on bamboo, fluffy fur, adorable expression, soft lighting"

### Negative Prompts
Use negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements:
- "blurry, low quality, distorted, ugly, poorly drawn"
- "extra limbs, deformed, mutated, bad anatomy"

## üîß Configuration

### GPU Setup
The application automatically detects and uses GPU acceleration when available. For optimal performance:

1. Install CUDA toolkit
2. Use the CUDA-optimized requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r cuda_torch_requirements.txt
   ```

### Model Configuration
The project uses Stable Diffusion v1.5 by default. Models are automatically downloaded on first use and cached for future sessions.
